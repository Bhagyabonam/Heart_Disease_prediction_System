# Heart Disease Prediction System using machine learning
>The aim of this project is to predict heart disease using data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms.This project implements 4 classificiation models using scikit-learn: Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Classifier and Decision Tree Model to investigate their performance on heart disease datasets obtained from the UCI data repository.

All the machine learning features can be viewed here: [Machine Learning features](predict_risk/machine_learning_models)
